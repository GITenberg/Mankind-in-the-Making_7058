description: "Mankind in the Making (1903) is H.G. Wells's sequel to Anticipations\
  \ (1901). Mankind in the Making analyzes the \"process\" of \"man's making,\" i.e.\
  \ \"the great complex of circumstances which mould the vague possibilities of the\
  \ average child into the reality of the citizen of the modern state.\" Taking an\
  \ aggressive tone in criticizing many aspects of contemporary institutions, Wells\
  \ proposed a doctrine he called \"New Republicanism,\" which \"tests all things\
  \ by their effect upon the evolution of man.\"\nThe volume consists of eleven \"\
  papers\" that were first published in the British Fortnightly Review from September\
  \ 1902 to September 1903 and in the American Cosmopolitan, and an appendix. It was\
  \ reprinted by Chapman and Hall in 1906 in a cheaper edition, and again in 1914,\
  \ on the eve of World War I.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
